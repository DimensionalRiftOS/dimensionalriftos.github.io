                    <p>
                       Dimensional Rift is a Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution focused on privacy and security. The system is built entirely around I2P (Invisible Internet Project), a peer-to-peer (P2P) anonymous communication network. I2P uses a technique called garlic routing, a form of multi-layer encryption that makes traffic analysis more difficult while also providing protection against attacks.Dimensional Rift comes with a hardened Firefox variant specifically configured for I2P. This browser can only access the I2P network, with clearnet connections deliberately blocked. When clearnet access is required, a separate Firefox browser included in the system can be used instead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, Dimensional Rift includes multi-layered hardening settings to defend against cyberattacks. The system also enhances privacy by automatically removing certain usage traces upon shutdown.

                        <p><strong>Q: What makes Dimensional Rift different from regular Debian?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: I2P comes pre-installed and configured with an easy-to-use GUI. It allows you to easily configure I2P ports. It comes with a special Firefox variant for I2P that cannot access clearnet, only .i2p sites. The browser and system are resistant to attacks.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Q: I'm new to Linux, is Dimensional Rift suitable for me?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: If you're interested in the I2P network, yes. Installation and usage are extremely easy.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Q: Is Dimensional Rift open source?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: Completely open source. You can access it from GitHub.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Q: What is I2P? How is it different from Tor?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: I2P (Invisible Internet Project) is a network that provides anonymous communication over the internet. Unlike Tor, it's designed for internal network traffic. I2P allows users to create their own anonymous services ("eepsites") and communicate securely within the network.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Q: Garlic Routing vs Onion Routing</strong></p>
                        <p>A: I2P uses garlic routing instead of Tor's "onion routing". Garlic routing encrypts multiple messages within a single packet, making traffic analysis and tracking even more difficult, enhancing privacy. While Tor encrypts each message with separate layers, I2P bundles packets together ("garlic cloves"), reducing traceability.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Q: Can I access the regular internet with I2P? Are there exit nodes?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: I2P is primarily designed for services within its own network - eepsites and I2P messaging. Regular internet (clearnet) access is limited. Yes, theoretically "I2P exit nodes" allow internet access, but this isn't as widespread or secure as Tor's method. Exit nodes are generally limited, and it's always safer to stay within I2P for security/anonymity.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Q: Can my ISP see that I'm using I2P?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: Yes, they can see you're connected but not what you're doing. Your ISP can detect that you're connected to the I2P network and identify that packets belong to I2P, but they cannot see the content, which sites you visit, or your messages due to I2P's end-to-end encryption and garlic routing.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Q: I'm using Dimensional Rift in a restrictive country, what should I do?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: Enable Hidden Mode in the I2P Router.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Q: Can I use it together with Tor?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: Theoretically possible but not recommended. Tor + I2P combination requires complex configuration, can reduce performance, and may complicate I2P's own security philosophy. Using I2P within its own network in Rift is the safest method.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Q: What is Firefox I2P Edition?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: A Firefox variant customized for the I2P network. It blocks ads and scripts and includes many hardening settings. Clearnet access is completely disabled - the entire browser is forced to use the I2P network. Only Firefox and addon updates can use clearnet.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Q: How do I access the regular internet?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: Use the Firefox Clearnet browser. This is a separate browser for accessing clearnet.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Q: How do updates work?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: Updates are regularly obtained from Debian repositories. You'll receive security and package updates seamlessly from Debian and I2P repositories. There are no third-party repos.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Q: Who develops this distribution?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: Dimensional Rift is a side project of the Cyrethium (formerly Securonis) operating system. The distribution is developed by Cyrethium's developer. More info: https://cyrethium.org</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Q: Can I use Live USB?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: You can, but when you install the system, additional hardening settings and AppArmor become active. Therefore, installing is better. Still, the choice is yours - you can carry it as a live USB.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Q: I have an NVIDIA GPU, can I use it?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: You can use any NVIDIA card supported by the open source nouveau driver. Generally, it will boot without issues, but if your GPU is very old or very new, there might be problems.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Q: Can I use Dimensional Rift as an I2P server?</strong></p>
                        <p>A: Yes, use I2P Port Manager to configure your port settings. Then you can host your service.</p>

                            <li><strong>Firefox Clearnet shows I2P Edition icon:</strong> This is normal. Firefox customizations are done through profiles, so the I2P Edition icon appears each time. But you're using Firefox Clearnet. It's easy to distinguish - if you can't access clearnet, it's I2P Edition.</li>
                            <li><strong>Getting kernel panic:</strong> Nothing to worry about - it may be due to hardening settings, just restart.</li>
